Adding krita to AUTOMATIC1111's SD-webui
-------------------------------------------
EXPECTATION:
- Be able to run SD server with Gradio while having the krita plugin connectivity so that you don't have 
  to run multiple/different backends when switching between Krita and Gradio interface.

CAPABILITIES:
1. Krita server
- REST API driven features via Flask
    -> text2img
    -> img2img
    -> extra
        - face fixing
            1. GFPGAN
            2. CodeFormer
        - upscaling
            1. RealESRGAN

2. Krita plugin


APPROACH:
- Split krita into separate repo and use as submodule in SD repo.
- Stick to sddebz plugin approach but fix integration with current AUTOMATIC features. 
    -> Make use of imperator-maximus approach to api.py and api.bat

NEW IDEAS/FEATURES:
- 

KRITA-PLUGIN REPO:
- files
    -> server.py
        - Same as webui.py but with Flask REST API
    -> server.bat
        - Same as webui.bat with abiility to accept input arguments and install additional requirements.
    -> requirements.txt
    -> Krita-plugin
